A flutter app to read news from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

## Getting Started

Installation steps:

2. Go inside the project folder: <code>cd simple_news_client</code>
3. Install dependencies: <code>flutter pub get</code>

## Or
You can open the project in VS Code and do all the previous stuff from there. I have included a launch.json file in the repo so it should be ready to build and run.

Note: This project was developed with Flutter 3.16.7, if you have compatibility issues, you would propably want to use that version. You can use [Sidecick](https://github.com/fluttertools/sidekick) for easy switching between versions.
